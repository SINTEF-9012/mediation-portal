# The Mediation Portal #

The Mediation Portal developed by SINTEF ICT is a set of web services that help rapidly prototyping complex mediation algorithms between data models. Data mismatches are recurrent obstacles to system interoperability and always require human intervention to develop *ad hoc* solutions, or to finely tune existing mediation algorithms in the most favourable cases. In this setting, the Mediation Portal will help you define your mediation algorithm using a specific [*Domain Specific Language* (DSL)](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domain-specific_language) especially designed to foster the development of mediation algorithms.

The services available are:

 - The **model repository**, which stores models

 - The **mapping repository**, which stores mapping

 - The **mediator service**, which calculates mapping between the data model

 - The **comparator service**, which compares a given mapping against another one

 - The **comparison repository**, which stores mappings comparisons
