			  REMICS "DOME" DEMO
			      SINTEF ICT
				 2012
			---------------------


The objectives of this demo are: 

 (1) To give an overview of the DSL used to specify behavior mediators 

 (2) To compile this DSL to WP6 models@runtime engine, which provides a graphical view of the mediator, useful for testing purposes

 (3) To compile this DSL to FP7 DiVA models@runtime, which provide model-based dynamic deployment capabilities, in order to validate the dynamic replacement of a service by another one


1. Setup
========

Make sure you have Java and Maven installed on your computer

- cd into org.remics.dome (this project contains the business object of the DOME case study)
- mvn clean install


1. Overview of the DSL
======================

- Launch ThingMLEditor.jar
- choose org.remics.dome.models/src/main/models as the folder where to initialize the editor
- in the editor, relevant models are located in studies/remics/dome
- open the "mediatorToAlternative" model, which is the most complete sample


2. Compiling to WP6 Models@runtime engine
=========================================

- in the editor: Compile->Experimental/PauWare
- it will generate a new folder in C:\Users\your-login\AppData\Local\Temp\ThingML_temp\Dome_demo or in a similar temp folder if you are using Linux or Mac OS.
- cd into this generated folder, then execute:
	$ mvn clean package exec:java -Dexec.mainClass="org.thingml.generated.MainPauWareDome_demo"
- you should see something like:

Tests run: 0, Failures: 0, Errors: 0, Skipped: 0

- in a web browser, go to: localhost:8082
- it open a web page where you can actually interact with the 

2. Compiling to FP7 DiVA models@runtime engine
==============================================

- remove the "Dome_demo" folder from your temp folder
- in the editor, Compile->Java/Swing, Compile->Scala/SMaC (please close the pop-up window/terminal), Compile->Java/Kevoree
- cd into this generated folder, then execute:
	$ mvn clean install
- it should produce something like:

- you can now run KevoreeEditorSnapshot.jar
- Model->Load CoreLibrary->JaveSE
- Model->Load Library->browse to C:\Users\your-login\AppData\Local\Temp\ThingML_temp\Dome_demo\target\Dome_demo-1.0-SNAPSHOT
- You can now create a configuration with:
  - a JavaSE node called "node0"
  - a group (green icons) of type NanoRESTGroup, managing node0
  - a client component
  - a server component
  - connect the client's ports to the server's port using defMSG channels
- you can now run KevoreeRuntimeSnapshotGUI.jar, and wait a few second for proper initialization
- in the graphical editor, select node0 and "push"
- it should deploy the configuration
- in the graphical editor, update the configuration (e.g., by removing the server and replacing it with the mediator + alternative server)
- push this new configuration
